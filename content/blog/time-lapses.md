I love making time lapses. I love photography in general, but time lapses allow
me to capture a little scene of activity, like a little burst of life, in a
pleasing and fun format to watch. If I'm being honest, they also let me capture
people, or at least their movement, without having to deal with people. 

With time lapses, I'm very much mostly interested in movement around, near, or
into some sort of interesting static object such as a building or tunnel.
Because of that interest, I don't much care for the features or details of
people, but I do like the nice blurry lines they create for me.

## Subject
Usually interesting buildings, or just buildings of note, are great places to
get a time lapse. More often than not they have large crowds of people walking
in and around them, especially if it's a tourist trap.

Museums and art galleries are a good subject too, but the exact reasons above.
The same with anything that people attend often, such as cinemas or theatres.
Places with a lot of people motion.

Roads are also great, especially at night.

## Equipment
I don't have anything too fancy at this point in time. However I'm often very
pleased with the results I produce despite having prosumer grade goods.

- Sony A6000
- Sony 16mm f2.8
- Manfrotto Compact Action
- 15,000 Milliamp power brick, for recharging
- Spare battery for the camera
- Spare 64GB SD card

That's all I have at this moment in time. I do also have/want the following
gear, but I've not got around to learning how to use it yet or I haven't bought
it:

- Filter adapter (own)
- Battery grip for additional battery power
- A sliding mount for doing time lapses that move and slide along or around in
  an arch

There's probably more kit I need, but then who ever has enough equipment?

## Process
The process is rather very simple and requires little effort, to be honest. The
important thing to remember is you need to find a good subject to base the time
lapse around. Once you have this, then you...

1. Set the tripod in the area 
1. Mount the camera and compose the scene 
1. Set to manual (including focus) and adjust settings
1. Take a test shot, or two, and adjust settings
1. Go back to (1) if the scene/framing/location doesn't seem right
1. Load the "Time Lapse" app' on the A6000
1. Set the same manual settings, including focus, as the app' saves its own
   settings outside the camera's
1. Press the shoot button to begin the intervolometer (time lapse)

Generally speaking, I get 480 shots, which equates to 20 seconds of final
footage at 24 frames per second. However, going forward I'm going to increase
this to 720 so I have some movement either side of the time lapse incase
something doesn't work out.

## Tips
- Always use a blank SD card per shoot/scene
- Take note of the light: is it clear skies or cloudy? Clouds make the light
  change throughout the time lapse
