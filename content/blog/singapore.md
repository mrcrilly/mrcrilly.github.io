So, Singapore: great public transport, a big boat on a building, I'm Kim's
Korean BBQ, and $3 Michelin Star chicken. 

## Transport
The system we used exclusively was the **SMRT**. I like this stands
for Singapore, Metro, and Rail Transit, but actually it stands for something
boring: the company's values.

When we arrived, we bought a "NETS FlashPay" which cost S$12 each. It was S$5
for the card and S$7 for the initial travel value. This S$7 went a long way for
us. We managed to get through our entire two nights, two days trip. We only
topped up once for S$10 (the minimum amount.) We were told this could be
refunded but as we're returning later on we decided to keep the value on the
cards.

The cards last five years.

## Food
We found food to be very cheap, provided you stayed away from the tourist areas
around the river in the CBD. Most of the food there ranged between S$15-30 for
a dish that would cost $5 in a side street.

We only aimed to visit one known location: the Mitchelin Star chicken rice, but
we also encountered I'm Kim's Korean BBQ.

The former was very cheap but also very tasty. It was incredible to find it's
priced at S$3.80 for the rice dish and S$4.80 for the noodle version. It's the
cheapest Mitchelin Star meal in the world. Totally worth the 20 minute wait.

The Korean BBQ joint was very cool. We've experienced something similar in
Brisbane, but it was still fun. Essentially there's a hot plate in the middle
of the table and for a flat fee (which we roughly recall to be about S$35 per
person on a Sunday) you get to fill plates up with raw and cooked meats,
veggies, and so on, and cook them to perfection.

We did have a third eating experience too: high tea at the Ritz Carlton. It was
S$60 per person and pretty delightful. Eight courses in total and the service
was excellent. Highly recommended. It's much more filling than you'd think and
it's a good excuse to eat a lot of cake.

## The Boat Building
Also known as Marina Bay Sands. It was quite a sight. It certaintly made for a
good photo. We decided against going up to the top, however. Aimee dislikes
hights and it cost S$27 each. I didn't feel the experience was worth it.

## Overall Impression
Beautiful city. Very clean and well kept.
