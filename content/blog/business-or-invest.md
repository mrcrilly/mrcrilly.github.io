I feel the best use of your excess money is buying other businesses whilst
creating your own. That is to say...

1. Investing and creating a new business is better than investing alone;
1. Investing alone is preferrable to creating a new business;
1. Creating a new business is better than working (for someone else) your whole
   life

These opinions are based on wanting to accumulate wealth and become financially
independant. A quick example is in order.

You have $100,000 available to you. You can do with it as you please. You can
either:

1. Simply spend the money;
1. Be overly cautious and instead, save the cash away in a savings account
   where it will rot due to inflation;
1. Create a new business and try to grow it, bring in cash and eventually
   become wealthy (hopefully);
1. Invest the money into exists businesses and have it grown for you
   (hopefully);

Ignoring (1) and (2), you opt to either start a business or buy shares in
existing businesses. Weighing up the two options, which is going to be the most
risky option for the accumulation of wealth: creating a new business and
working hard with the hope it will be successful, grow, and generate profits;
or buying into existing businesses that have proven they're already capable of
making profit and are run by experienced executives with decades of experience?

Starting a business is a great idea. I think it's important that everyone takes
a good shot at being entrepreneurial and tries their hand at starting a
business. After all if you can solve a problem for someone in a repeatible
manner and there's a market place for your solution, then why not take a shot
at selling the solution?

Investing in an already established, well vetted company you've researched
well, is a great way of owning a business that'll work for you, whilst you
sleep, and generate wealth over the long term. It's also a safer use of your
money because it's dramatically less risky buying into an existing business
than it is creating your own.

On one hand starting a business is expensive, hard, and will likely burn the
$100,000 quickly (not to mention fail like most new businesses do); and on the
other hand buying into existing businesses removes your control and input, and
forces you to trust others to do right by you, the share holder.

I fully appreciate the choices here: take full control and drive the car your
self, or simply get comfortable in the back and hope you've selected the right
driver (and car.) Thinking with my head and not with my heart, I believe my
conclusion to be correct: investing the money into established, well run
businesses is safer than attempting to create something new.

They're both a risk, but one is much more of a risk than the other.
