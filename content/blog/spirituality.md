As far as I'm concerned, science has done a pretty good job of explaining how
the Universe, Earth, and our very species came into existence.

The theory of the Big Bang has a reasonable amount of evidence to support it
and from our limited view of the Universe it's almost an obvious conclusion.
There could possibly be aspects about the Big Bang that we've got wrong, but I
believe the basic premise to be correct.

Geologists can explain, with a boat loads of evidence, the time scales on which
massive geological events took place. We can predict, we quite a lot of
accuracy, what the Earth would have looked like many millions of years ago. The
rocks don't lie.

Our dear friend Charles Darwin literally wrote the book on evolution,
eloquently and brilliantly laying down the mechanics that explain how we went
from single celled organisms to the ["monkeys in
shoes"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1EhaANeYCI&t=6m12s) you see around you
today.

Although they're not perfect or complete theories, nor do they offer all
the answers (yet), they're quite sufficient for me. Sufficient enough to make
God something a little closer to home.

So if science is exploring the mechanics of the Universe, who's attempting to
explore our purpose? Science is helping us with the "why" from the perspective of
**causation**, but how are we going about answering the "why" from the
perspective of **purpose**?

The meaning of life is no small question and I'm certainly not going to try and
answer it here. It's a question we've all been grapling with since the dawn of
time and in some ways I think we always will be confronted with it, never to
find an answer. It might even be futile to try. At the same time I believe it's
important that we attempt to find our individual purpose in life. Where do we
fit in and how should we be helping others?

I believe this question can be made much more succint: what is my why?

Another important question is how do I consistently remind myself of that
purpose, and its underlaying values and principles, and remember to bring it
into everything I do on a daily basis?

It's easy enough to read about values and principles, dicipline and time
management. There is plenty of reading material on those matters and once
I've gone over several books... what then? Where do I take this new found
knowledge? How do I apply it? What system of application do I use? If
I'm still looking for a working system that works for me, when do I stop looking? What
happens if there is a better system around the corner - I might miss out!

I've felt this level of confusion for a while. I've felt lost.

I really love the question of "Why?" from the perspective Simon Sinek presents
it. It's deep and meaningful. It has us questioning our actions. It certainly
knocked me back for a while. It had be dazed and contemplating the very thing
Simon wanted me to contemplate: why do I do what I do?

It's a hard question to answer. Unless you've
really meditated on the idea you can't provide an answer straight off the bat.
Not an honest one, anyway. It's a tough question. I believe it was this
question that took me on a more spiritual journey and I'm beginning to see that
bringing a spiritual view of society into our lives is the only manner in which
we can answer this question for ourselves. 

So now we have two versions of the same question: "Why are we here?" from the
perspective of life as a whole; and, "Why do I do whatever it is that I do?"
from the perspective of life on a personal level.

Science is a discipline that doesn't concern itself with matters of
spirituality. It's not really concerned with how one should live their
lives or behave within society. And although science is well on its way to
conquering the mechanics of the Universe, it doesn't really have a place
explaining how one should help the homeless, better understand other people or
how to act towards others in general.


## The Right(?) Question
I think the right question to ask my self is: what do I want?

I believe it's clarity surrounding my purpose. A moral code to help me decide
what is right and what is wrong. A compass by which to lead my own life and
helps the lives of others. And a set of rituals and rites that keep me focused
on that path.

A moral code that is rooted in history and having been tested by many (millions
of) people all over the world, reinforced through social contracts and
continuously studied and remembered through rituals is what I'm craving. It's
what I believe will relax my anxiety about my place and involvement in society
and make me feel as though I'm actually trying to make the world a better
place.

Not all bad has come from years of being an Atheist though. In fact I believe
I've come to a sound conclusion with regards to how I can practice Religious
rituals and gather in a temple that satisfies both parts of my mind.

### God

With my understanding that science has done, and will continue to do, a rather
good job of explaining the mechanics of the Universe and life, I feel that God,
as a concept, has been relegated down to Earth. I do believe in "God", but not
as a "Supreme Being" but as a "Supreme Society". That's a term that's going to
need some explaining.

As a collective we're known as a society. Society is what "contains" us all and
we have to live together within society as equals. We all have our place within
society and we should all equally benefit from the fruits of this society.

Today this isn't the case.

If in fact we did live in such as society, then you might call that a "Supreme
Society" because everyone is equal, the law is fair and just, all religions
and beliefs are celebrated, the political system is balanced and free of
corruption, and as a singular unit, as a "Supreme Society", we reach for the
stars and explore the Universe. As an idea it's absolutely "Supreme" in nature
to what we have today (massive inequality, war, corruption, ...)

For me God doesn't represent something "up there" but instead represents what
we could become down here, on Earth. The concept of a God is the concept of
balance and perfection.  If we can attain such balance and perfection then it's
us that become God. We become the Supreme Society.

Do I believe in God? Yes. I believe we can attain a better version of what we
have now. It won't be in my life time, but it will come.

## Religion

I was born a Roman Catholic. Like a lot of children in the north of England
were. My parents never really took the faith seriously and nor did I. We never
went to church despite the fact we had one at the end of our street. I've
never actually read the Bible cover to cover or in any complete sense. I can't
remember, nor care to remember, the Lord's Pray even though it was practiced
daily at school.

I think it's safe to say I make for a pretty crap Roman Catholic.

To really nail the point home, I remember once at school, which was Roman
Catholic of course, turning away a teacher's offer of a bible during a
Religious Education (RE) lesson whilst clearly stating, "I need that. I don't
believe that crap." I'd have slapped me too looking back. Needless to say the
teacher wasn't impressed and I was removed from the class and nearly the
school.

As time went on I eventually became an Atheist. I had been brought under the
wing of a dear friend of mine, David Edwards, who was an academic and
intellectual giant. Without going into my past too much, I should point out
that David also taught me the computer programming languages C and JavaScript.
He's single handily responsible for my entire career to this day. Thank you,
David.

As well as being a nerd friend and helping me with me mathematics homework,
David also introduced me to Atheism and Richard Dawkins. He taught me the value
of reason and a secular approach to understanding the Universe. I'll be the
first to admit that I'm an impressionable person who is easily convinced of
well presented ideas, but even those of an opposing disposition would find it
hard to argue with science's explanation of of the Universe's origins and
Dawin's theory of evolution.

In short, the Big Bang is a sound theory and evolution happened. And science is
well on its way to explaining more and more about the mechanics of the Universe
and how life came to be. But it can't explain everything and it doesn't work in
all situations.

As time marched on I remained an Atheist and became quite militant about it. I
rejected absolutely any notion of religion or spirituality. If you believed in
God, you were automatically an idiot. I felt sorry for you. Now of course I've
come to realise how wrong I was and underserstand I have a lot to learn from
religion.
