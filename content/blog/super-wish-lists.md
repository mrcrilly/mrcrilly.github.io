- Blogging and vLogging has always been fun for me, but time and focus have never been in sync...
- Coming across a (minor) family problem to solve put things into perspective and gave me some solid to do...
- This is where Super Wish Lists (a dorky name, I know -- I even have the domain name!) comes into the frame...
- It's going to solve the wish list problem my friends and family has, and hopefully with the release of superwishlists.com.au, it'll solve the same problem for others...
- It's also going to be open-source (license not known at this point) so you can join in...
- But, there's more...
- The construction of the application, all three components (four when I introduce Android into the fold) are not only in the open because they will be OSS...
- I've broken the construction of each component into tasks, and each high level task not only represents a step towards the component coming to life, but a blog post and a vlog...
- So I'll be publishing a blog post whenever I complete a task, but I'll write it as I go...
- After the blog post is written and published, a vLog will follow on the OpsFactory YouTube channel...
- These two additional steps to the development process will offer a great opportunity for others to learn from my work, mistakes, errors, bugs, security issues, and as new technologies are introduced...
- It'll be a great learning experience...
- Here is how you can help...
- Watch this space for the next article in the Super Wish List series: architecture! ...
