title: "I'm bad at focus"

I recently started working on Ray Dalio's new book, "Principles." In 1.6c, Ray says that most people avoid pain, especially when the pain is people confronting the reality of their own imperfections. I believe this to be true of my self, so I wanted to note the emotions this stirred up in me and jot down my thoughts.

I do know of one imperfection I have and that's focus. Life has a lot to offer in terms of fun things to do but also problems to be solved. I can't do all the fun things and solve all the problems. I must pick and choose, and focus accordingly.

I'll start with "Principles", reading it through and journaling my thoughts here.
