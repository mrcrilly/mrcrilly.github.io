On my path to becoming a financial planner, I obviously have to undertake courses and, eventually, a degree. Deciding what courses to take wasn't overly difficult as you're restricted in what you can do.

However what was hard was decided where to start, what to skip, and who to train with.

When it comes to being a Financial Planner, you have to comply with ASIC's RG146 regulations. These regulations state that an FP has to be trained to Diploma level and have an Australian Financial Services licence, or AFS, to give financial advise or provide financial services in Australia. Therefore a Diploma in Financial Planning is a requirement at this point in time.

These RG146 regulations are due to change, however. The new requirements will be as follows:

- You will need a degree as a new financial planner from the 1st January 2019
- You have to work in a one year supervisory role and then sit an exam
- If you're an existing financial planner, you have until 2022 to pass the exam
- If you're an existing financial planner, you have until 2024 to meet the educational standards (a degree, I believe.)

More information [can be found here.](https://fpa.com.au/policy/policy-issues/education-and-professional-standards-requirements/)

For now I'm going one step at a time.

So where do I start? In short:

- 2017-2018: Principles of Valuation: Time Value of Money (Coursera)
- 2018-2019: Diploma in Financial Planner at Monarch Institute
- 2019-2021: Advanced Diploma in FP at Monarch Institute
- 2021-2022: Travel Europe for a year
- 2022-2025: Business School at QUT for a degree in Finance
- 2025-*: Who knows?

The total estimated study time and costs will be roughly 5-6 years and come to around $50,000 (given the expense of the degree and taking into account increased fees by 2022.) This is a long time, but then retraining and moving into another industry always is a lengthy process. Especially when that industry is, or is going to be, tightly regulated. 

I'm looking forward to the challenge and in the mean time I can blog about my studies, how my own personal financial situation is developing, and also work on my four tier financial independence plan.
