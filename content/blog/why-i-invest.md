When I think back to [my history with money]({{<relref "a-bit-of-history.md">}}) I realise how lucky I am today. Only a few years ago I was drowning in debt. I had debt obligations in the tens of thousands. Now I have savings in the tens of thousands and a newly minted investment portfolio. Things change, and all it took was some reading and listening.

The first book I read that really got me thinking about my financial situation was [Rich Dad, Poor Dad](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1612680194/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1612680194&linkCode=as2&tag=mrcrillyblog-20&linkId=5879fbb83eb5efa50d2b8073f6dc1ba4) by [Robert Kiyosaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kiyosaki). Not many people like Robert's book, but I enjoyed the message he was trying to tell us: our traditional views on money, and earning it, need to be questioned and carefully considered. And he's right.

After Mr Kiyosaki's book, I bumped into many other characters, one of whom was [Dave Ramsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Ramsey). If I showed some of my friends his videos, they would likely have the same reaction to Dave as they would to Robert. But Mr Ramsey is also teaching us a valuable lesson: money is our primary wealth building asset. And HE'S right, too!

Both Mr Kyosaki and Mr Ramsey have had a profound impact on how I approached all money related matters, including debt, savings, and investments.

I certainly don't agree with everything they have to say, however.

For example, I disagree with Mr Kiyosaki that higher education outside of financial education is a waste of time. We need scientists. We need artists and art teachers. We need fitness instructors. All these people are needed throughout our society. I believe this to be true despite [the fact I'll be studying finance]({{<relref "study-path.md">}}) in the near future. 

I also don't agree with Mr Ramsey with regards to using "growth stock mutal funds." I don't mutual funds, and I don't believe you can get "12%" as Mr Ramsey claims you can. Perhaps I've not done my homework well enough, but I'm unable to find such funds, and so are others.

Neither of these points take away the lessons I learnt from these great men: money is like a seed, you can either eat it or sow it, and working the fields to earn it all your life isn't ideal.

## Financial Independence
Without so much as saying the words directly, or talking to the concept of FI/RE, Robert Kiyosaki put me onto the topic of financial independence. Dave Ramsey less so, but he does talk more to not retiring poor, which is a some what similiar principle.

This is this my objective.

The concept of financial independence is really simple: invest as much of your wages as you can over the coming years and if done correctly (and it's hard to get wrong), you'll eventually develop a passive income that matches your income from your employer. At this stage you can either move on from employment or move on to something you've always wanted to do.

This concept might put off a lot of people, some might even consider it impossible on their current wages, but for most this isn't the case. I wont lie and say my fiance and I don't enjoy great wages, because we do. However this is a game of percentages and being realistic about life, something I want to cover in another post. 

For me this concept changed the way I approach money. I now view money as something that can be used to build a business, but not in the traditional sense of factories and employees, but in the sense that money can be a sole employee that can and should be made to work full time, all the time.

And I need this employee. With the studying I want to do at university in a few years, I need a passive income to make it possible. I don't know what life looks like after univesity, but wouldn't it be nice to not have to worry about that?

As Mr Ramsey said, money is our number one wealth building tool, but I prefer to call it my number one wealth building employee.

That's why I invest.
