My view regarding anyone who is transgender is they're simply equal in all
ways.

The trans community is paving the way for a more open, fluid society in which
the acceptance of new ideas is paramount and everyone's opinion and way of life
is accepted as valid.

I believe the trans community is a brave new way forward for all of us. I
believe that when a person decides to make as strong a statement as, "I don't
fit into the boxes society has presented me with" they're making an incredibly
powerful and brave choice.

They're taking their incredibly rare gift of life and choosing to use it in a
way that opposes social norms and instead makes a statement about how ever
changing and fluid society really is. They're making a sacrifice to us all in
their endevour to express freedom of expression and thought.

It could be argued that the trans community is choosing to express themselves
by using their lives as the canvas and we, as a whole, absolutely have to be
paying attention to and supporting this important stage of our own evolution as
a species.

I understand that respecting their position helps us all grow as a society and
as such, I hold the transcommunity in high regard and with the upmost of
respect.

But...

Such a community cannot and will not achieve equal rights for all in isolation.
It's a societal effort, but also a two-way street. The political left and right
are opposing, but they need each other. You can't have just one side otherwise
you have a broken scale. You have chaos. This is why I have an issue with the
current pronoun situation: it's creating a one-way street.

I do not disagree with someone's right to replace "Mr" with something else, be
it "other", "binary", or whatever they feel identifies them. I run into issues
when the opinions of some are supressed or rejected as transphobic because they
differ from the opinions of the trans community.

Clearly some sentiments are just hateful. There will always be those people who
hate what they don't understand or don't want to understand. They will reduce a
situation to hateful speech and violance. They're not welcome in any debate,
let alone this one.

But simply stating that one does not agree with the notion of fluid or
non-binary genders does not constitute hateful speech. It also doesn't afford
the offended the right to not be offended in the future.

You can absolutely reject the notion of non-binary pronouns **and** support a
transgender's right to be whatever or whomever they want to be. It's a
spectrum. It's not a multiple choice exam. It's life and it's complicated.

We should be striving for equality for all, not just those going through a
(very personal) transformation.

Challenging any and all ideas is what we need in society.

How are we to know if an idea or opinion is right or wrong if the only view is
from one side of the debate? We need both views. We have to debate this to
discover the truth and in the process of finding the truth some will get hurt
as their ideas are rejected.

Challenging (and rejecting) ideas is something we **have** to do in order
for society to develop intellectually and emotionally. During the discourse of
such political debates it must be remembered, at all times, that we're simply
trying to identify the truth.

That's all we're ever really looking for, the truth, and all opinions should be
welcomed, considered, and applied or rejected on the **individual level**. Once
this happens over enough time, you'll have your answer in the form of
individual votes and reformed laws.

We've seen that with time the laws change to favour the opinion of the masses.
It's been witnessed in the UK and Australia with gun laws. We've seen same sex
marriage become legalised. Now is the time for cannabis and other drug laws to
be reformed so that people with addictions can get the help they need instead
of being shunned by society.

For the trans community we need to support their ideas and (positive) actions,
allowing them to flourish. Given enough time I'm confident that society as a
whole will see just how beautiful a concept theirs is and with that, laws will
be reformed in protect the equality of all.

We just need to keep talking.
