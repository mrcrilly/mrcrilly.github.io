When we invest we're put cash into an investment vehicle and in return, over the course of time, we get cash back in the form of dividends or coupon payments. With regards to shars and their dividends, there is another option that allows you to receive more shares in place of the cash you would have received. 

This feature is called a Dividend ReInvestment Plan, or DRIP (or just DRP). It's also sometimes referred to as as a DRS, or Dividend Reinvestment Scheme. Whatever it's called, it offers you an excellent way of automatically reinvesting your gains from investments without having to think about it.

This system has a lot of advantages. 

**It's automated investing**, so what's out of sight is out of mind, and can't be spent instead of being reinvested. This is a big bonus for those of us who would be tempted to use the money for other things, such as bacon.

**You sometimes get a discount on the new shares** being bought, but not always. Not all companies offer a discount on new shares purchased in this manner, but some do. This is usually between 1-5%. This puts you at an advantage over other investors buying new shares via a broker each investment cycle.

**You also avoid brokerage fees** when the new shares are purchased, which can add up to hundreds of dollars per year. I use MacQuarie as my bank and broker, and they charge $20 per trade. That's quite high, so I want to avoid it as much as possible. This means a DRIP saves me a tidy amount of loose change during dividend allocation season.

**Your investment grows on its own**. Despite the fact you're also putting in regular payment (right?), you investment is also growing organically like a tree, drawing its water from the reinvested dividends. This means once your investment reaches a certain stage, your dividends will be buying you hundreds of shares on a quartly, or semi-annual basis (depending on the dividend distribution schedule.) 

And of course like most things, DRIPs come with some disadvantages.

**Your dividends won't always perfectly match the share price**, so you'll have some cash left over. For example, if the share price is $10 and you make dividends of $16, you can afford one share at $10 with $6 left over. You *don't see this $6.* Instead ths $6 in our example is left with the company in their DRIP account, as opposed to your high interest savings account, and so doesn't make any interest.

The alternative to this is you take the dividends your self, having them hit your high interest savings account and then cycle them into your next investment stage further down the line. This option **requires discipline**, so please be honest with your self with regards to your ability to not spend this money.

It's also possible that in the event of a downfall, **you'll potentially pay a higher price for the shares** depending on when the DRIP triggers. That is to say if the share price is $10 when the DRIP triggers, there may be a downfall only moments later and the share price may drop to $8. This means you're paying $2 (or 20%) than the next investor.

One final note on the disadvantages: **the tax bill**. When you're due to pay tax on your dividends, you'll either have to use savings to pay the bill or not invest for a short peroid of time. This is because you have no dividends in your bank account to carve up and distribute between the process of buying more shares and paying the tax man. For most I don't believe this is an issue and can be overcome by simply not investing for a month or two and using that money to pay the tax man instead.

Another option is using short time, high interest savings to pay the tax bill and then topping that account back up out of your (non-invested) wages. This requires discipline too. It also requires either doing a quick tax calculation to understand how much of the dividend you need to keep back, to being conservative and keeping back 50% and investing the rest. This could be harmful to the growth of your portfolio if you just have money sat around at 3% instead of growing at 8%.

To summarise, **I believe DRIPs are a great idea.** I think they take away the hassle of having to remember to reinvest dividends. They also limit the responsibility and discipline required by the investor. Finally, they make an already complex topic easier to digest for those looking to get into the game of long term investing.

Have a great day and thanks for reading.
