I've seen a few posts in various financial sub-reddits as of late asking where to start learning about investing. It's a good question, and one I was asking my self twelve months ago, so I thought instead of just answering the question directly on Reddit, why not put together a blog post that can can be updated as time passes us by - a sort of knowledge base, if you will.

Now there are people out there more knowledable than I on all of these topics, so instead of writing out the material my self, this article will list links to external resources that will dive into the topic at hand. Hopefully this approach is useful.

A lot of resources, at least to begin with, will be centered around [Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com) simply because it's an excellent resource that's relatively well curated. Over time more resources will be introduced as this guide is perfected.

One final note: this is all about educating my self just as much as it is helping others educate themselves, so feel free to throw feedback my way (see the contact page) and I'll see about making sure it makes the guide.

Managed investment funds. They're good to know about, but they're considered too expensive in the Financial Independence arena, and not a good choice for early retirement.
