I currently have two forms of investment: my Superannuation and a private portfolio. I stack a lot of cash into both of them, totalling about $75,000 per year: $25,000 into the Superannuation (the maximum as of July 2017), and $50,000 into the private fund.

My Superannuation is given a lot of love because it represents my retirement and it's my safety net. That is to say: if my private investments should go wrong, be depleted, burnt through, or something else happens, my Superannuation is my safety net. It's (hopefully) got me covered when I retire. Better safe than sorry.

My private portfolio is aimed at financial independence and freedom. I like reading, studying, and working on creative ventures that range from photography to game development to writing. Work takes me away from these kinds of fun and creative tasks, so becoming financially independent means I can reduce my working hours and focus more on my happiness.

#### Superannuation
I currently use QSuper. I've been meaning to move to HostPlus because their ChoicePlus offering has very low management fees. Right now it's not too big a deal given I've only been in Australia for 2.5 years, which means I only have $20,000 total in my fund right now. I currently salary sacrifice and that brings my contributions up to $25,000 per year, so it'll jump a lot over the next few years.

My aim with my Super' is $500,000. I believe this is an excellent safety cushion and, at $25,000 per year, is 20 years away. As I'm 33 and have no intention of retiring, I'll be working when I'm 53. Ofcourse this is just in payments, not growth, so it'll be better than this if the portfolio performs well enough.

#### Private Portfolio
With my private portfolio, I'm aiming for income of $30,000 per year. That's all I want. That's all I need. Anything more is a bonus. Combined with my Superannuation, I alone should be able to produce a good income once it's time to leave the employment and travel. This doesn't include my wife's Superannuation.

For my private portfolio, I've gone with two ETFs:

- NDQ: 30%
- VAS: 70%

It doesn't contain any bonds, as you've probably worked out, and that's because I want it to be an aggressive portfolio. It's possibly a bad idea, but I can pivot easily enough if the market punishes my choices.

Hopefully the market favours my choices. Let's sit back and wait and see.
