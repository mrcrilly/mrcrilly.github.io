      On my path to becoming a financial planner, I obviously have to undertake courses and, eventually, a degree. Deciding what courses to take wasn&rsquo;t overly difficult as you&rsquo;re restricted in what you can do.
However what was hard was decided where to start, what to skip, and who to train with.
When it comes to being a Financial Planner, you have to comply with ASIC&rsquo;s RG146 regulations. These regulations state that an FP has to be trained to Diploma level and have an Australian Financial Services licence, or AFS, to give financial advise or provide financial services in Australia.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      I&rsquo;ve worked in IT for several years now. I&rsquo;ve been programming since I was 11. I&rsquo;m very pleased with my job and my career, but I want to move on. I want to be a financial advisor, planner, and friend in the know.
So why the change of heart?
As a younger man I was terrible with money. I had a lot of debt when I lived back home in the UK, to the tune of about A$40,000.
